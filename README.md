# Project Aurora

My own OS, based on the work of nanobyte.

## Project Vision

- [ ] Create a basic printing function for Assembly without using kernel things
- [ ] Create the bootloader that can load the OS from memory
- [ ] Create a very basic I/O system


## Building/Running

Use `make` to build. Use `qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main_floppy.img` to run.
